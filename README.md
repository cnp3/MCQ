[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cnp3/MCQ.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cnp3/MCQ)

This repository contains a series of *multiple choice questions* that
have been designed to help students understand the networking concepts that
are described in the second edition of the [Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols and Practice](http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be) open-source ebook.

These multiple choice questions are written as special sphinx directives that
processed by the [mcq.py](mcq/mcq.py) python script written by Lionel Chalet.

These multiple choice questions will migrate to the [INGInious](https://www.inginious.org) platform during the summer 2019.
