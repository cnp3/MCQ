Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols and Practice
*******************************************************

This repository contains a series of multiple choice questions that
have been designed to help students understand the networking concepts that
are described in the second edition of the `Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols and Practice <http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be>`_ open-source ebook.

These multiple choice questions are written as special sphinx directives that
processed by the `mcq.py <mcq/mcq.py>`_ python script written by Lionel Chalet.

These multiple choice questions will migrate to the `INGInious <https://www.inginious.org>` platform during the summer 2019.
